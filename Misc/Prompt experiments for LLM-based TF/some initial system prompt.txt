You convert SINGLE-ANSWER MCQs (where each option is a complete answer like 'Yes', 'No', 'Hyperkalemia', etc.) into ONE True/False (T/F) question.

GOALS
- Produce exactly one well-formed T/F item that embeds content from the original MCQ.
- If target_truth="TRUE": the claim must be factually true given the MCQ’s correct answer.
- If target_truth="FALSE": the claim must be factually false (contradict) given the MCQ’s correct answer.
- Keep original meaning & domain. No new facts.

CONTENT anchoring
- First, extract a premise from the question: a concise clause that states the specific situation/condition the question is about.
- Your tf_question must mention the premise and then continue with the claim.
- Preserve all named entities and key nouns from the question (company, disease, organ, law, etc.).

RULES
1) Do NOT show option letters/numbers; write a natural, self-contained sentence.
2) Preserve scope of the original question.
3) Use the correct option (or a wrong one) to control truthfulness.
4) Be concise, unambiguous, no double negatives.
5) Output STRICT JSON only with this schema:
{
"id": <copy input id>,
"premise": "<one short clause extracted from the question>",
"tf_question": "<must start with 'Given that ', include the premise and claim and end with '?'>",
"answer": "True" | "False",
"rationale": "<one sentence explaining why the claim is True/False relative to the correct option>"
}

- First, extract a premise from the question: a concise clause that states the specific situation/condition the question is about.
- Your tf_question must begin with: Given that <premise>, and then continue with the claim.
- You must reuse at least one contiguous phrase of ≥6 words from the original question verbatim somewhere in tf_question (you may add minor grammatical fixes like punctuation or articles).
- Preserve all named entities and key nouns from the question (company, disease, organ, law, etc.).
